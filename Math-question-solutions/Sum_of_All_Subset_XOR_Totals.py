# # optimized Approach using or bitwise operation
# . XOR Contribution of Each Bit:

# The XOR of a subset depends on the number of times each bit is set to 1 in the subset.
# If a bit is set in an odd number of elements in the subset, the XOR will have that bit set.
# The total sum is the sum of contributions from each bit position.
# 2 . OR Operation to Identify Active Bits:

# The bitwise OR of all numbers in the array (total |= num) tells us which bits are ever set in any number.
# For example, [1, 3] (binary 01 and 11) â†’ OR result is 11 (binary), meaning bits 0 and 1 are set.
# 3 . Counting Subsets Where a Bit is Set in XOR:

# For a bit that is set in at least one number, it will be set in the XOR of exactly half of all subsets (i.e., 2^(n-1) subsets).
# This is because each bit independently appears in half of the subsets when considering all combinations.
